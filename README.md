# Creating Digital Brand Guidelines

## Introduction

## Questions to ask before you start

Because of the flexibility and functionality online guidelines can provide to the user, it's important to understand who those users are going to be, and for what reasons they'll be accessing the guidelines. Here are some questions worth asking before you start planning and creating content.

### What design work are the guidelines primarily going to support?

What areas of design are the guidelines going to support?

* Brand positioning and values?
* Print design?
* Interior/Exterior spaces?
* Animation and film?
* Social media?
* Digital products?

### Who will be using the guidelines?

Are the guidelines for internal teams? External designers/agencies working for you? The general public?

### Is the intention to create an internal support structure or team around the guidelines?

Will someone be designated an owner or evangelist for the guidelines? Is the intention that the guidelines be developed, updated and improved over time?

## Creating content

### Colours

Giving descriptive names to all the primary brand colours is important. Web colours can take these names as the basis for CSS custom properties or design tokens. This can be suggested in the supporting copy or explicitly specced out.

### Images

A review of other brand guidelines, complex diagrams are not used for high-level brand definition work. Brand pillars or foundations or claims or whatever they’re called at generally “Heading + Text”, either as basic text or in a table.

Image and Caption combinations that rely on a specific layout or spatial arrangement won’t work as part of a responsive design.

Images need to be intelligible at small screen sizes. Keep them simple and use them to illustrate points that are made in the captions or associated text. Guidelines are often clearer when expressed in copy and supported by example images? We need to keep things accessible. Rules only baked into images aren’t really good enough for this.

### Logos

The digital use of logos should be considered when creating logos. These could include:

* Social Media avatars (typically square or circular)
* Website favicon (16px square)

A suite of logos should include one that will work in these situations.

Sizes for digital logos expressed solely in pixels can be problematic, because pixel density and the resulting physical size of the logo vary depend on the device display. It may be useful to provide some physical size guides for different uses (e.g. mobile phone, Video/TV, desktop/laptop computers, etc.)

### Animations

* Animations take time and care to create, so they should be used sparingly and only in situations where an animation is the best way to highlight or demonstrate part of the guidelines.
  * e.g. Showing an animated element moving
  * e.g. Showing timing examples
  * e.g. Showing an animation asset
  * e.g. Visualising the thinking behind the composition of a core brand asset.
  * e.g. Showing the association between two aspects of the guidelines, such as colour and where it is used in a component or page’s composition.
* Examples where an animation shouldn’t be used:
  * Where the pertinent information is in the last frame or a small part of the animation:
    * e.g. A layout rule animating into existence and only being complete at the end of the animation.
    * e.g. A static asset or layout example, with the elements animating in to their final, real-world positions.

### Copy and Language

“What we are” vs “What we do”. I’m not sure applying a set of aspirational adjectives to “ourselves” is the best way to express the brand values. Maybe focus more on what we do. Don’t confuse brand with culture/people. They are closely linked, but separate things. People have bad days. Seeing themselves referred to as “obsessively innovative” or something won’t ring true, either internally or externally.

Example from Interface: *"Interface is its people — authentic people who bring their whole, undivided selves to work, and to the world. We’re empowered to speak out, to stand out, and to reach out."*

Who’s the “we”? The company or the individuals within it?

Other guidelines are focused on verbs, doing things, rather than adjectives describing themselves.

e.g. Starbucks Creative Expression.

Case Studies. Rather than unstructured showcases. Should we create more detailed case studies, showing the application of the brand in a real-world, start-to-finish way?

E.g. Material Studies - https://material.io/design/material-studies/about-our-material-studies.html#product-architecture

Examples from Interface: 

* “Headlines should be punchy in length”.*
* “We would always suggest keeping copy length tight to maintain impact.”*

It’s not clear what this means, other than short.

So use basic vocabulary. You can’t assume all users of the guide will have English as their first language and/or understand descriptive terms you may take for granted.

### Design Tokens

Design tokens provide a platform agnostic way of managing key brand and design values and assets. As such, they are a part of the digital guidelines that could be included relatively early, maybe in general terms at least. The precise implementation would probably need internal discussion and more work, but highlighting which elements of the guidelines should form the basis for a system of design tokens would be worthwhile, particularly for a client with a strong digital requirement or presence.
